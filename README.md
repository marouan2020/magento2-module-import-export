# magento2-module-import-export
Command-Line Importer allows you to import and export data using Magento 2 SSH commands. You can schedule cron jobs to import unlimited products into your store. When the store owner wants to change their websites into new ones, they have to manually add a lot of products on the new sites again. You can't upload large size products CSV file using Magento 2 and, this process can take a lot of time and human resources to do. To overcome this drawback of default Magento 2, this extension for Magento 2 is developed to help import large size Products file using Magento 2.  This extension directly fetches the images from the provided folder URL so it is a very easy, convenient, and time-saving process. You can also see the import history of your scheduled cron jobs with current status under the Magento import history in the admin. Also, you can upload all types of products (simple, configurable, etc...) with multiple images and videos. This extension will allow you to update product data which was already added.
